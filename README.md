## Code Details

The provided code is an example of the Diamond MT5 EA. It includes global variables, custom initialization, deinitialization, and start functions.

### Global Variables

- `LotSize`: Initial lot size for trading.
- `TakeProfit`: Take profit in pips.
- `StopLoss`: Stop loss in pips.
- `MaxLotSize`: Maximum lot size for trading.
- `MinLotSize`: Minimum lot size for trading.
- `MagicNumber`: Unique identifier for trades.
- `TrailingStop`: Trailing stop value in pips.
- `MaxAttempts`: Maximum number of attempts for the Martingale strategy.
- `MartingaleFactor`: Martingale factor for lot size increase.

### Custom Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is a custom initialization function. It sets the recommended lot size and displays a message if the lot size exceeds 0.1 lot.

### Custom Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is a custom deinitialization function. It performs necessary cleanup tasks when the EA is being deinitialized.

### Custom Start Function

The `OnTick()` function is a custom start function. It checks for open trades and performs the Martingale strategy. Here's how it works:

1. Check if there are any open trades. If there are, exit the function.
2. Initialize variables for lot size, profit, and attempts.
3. Execute the Martingale strategy within a loop with a maximum number of attempts.
4. Calculate the stop loss based on the take profit and open a trade using the calculated lot size, take profit, and stop loss.
5. Check if the trade was opened successfully. If yes, reset the attempts counter, profit, and increase the lot size for the next trade.
6. If the trade was not opened successfully, increment the attempts counter, calculate the loss, and check if the maximum attempts have been reached. If yes, stop trading.
7. Set the initial stop loss for the first trade and check if it was set successfully. If not, close the trade.
8. Set the trailing stop and check if it was set successfully. If not, close the trade.
